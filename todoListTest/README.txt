Few words about this site:
1) I don't remove the todo item when it is checked(only adding line-through in css and changing status from 'In progress' to 'Done').
I have create remove button to remove items from list, because it is CRUD.
2) I did not make adaptivity because it was not specified at test task letter.(If you need adaptive - I can do this).
3) I have commented main parts of code in HTML and js file.

Technologies that a used:
HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap4, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJs.

Thanks for attention:)
